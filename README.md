# Fake-Product-Review-Monitoring

<h2>Abstract:</h2> Product reviews play an important role in
deciding the sale of a particular product on the ecommerce
websites or applications like Flipkart,
Amazon, Snapdeal, etc. In this paper, we propose a
framework to detect fake product reviews or spam
reviews by using Opinion Mining. The Opinion
mining is also known as Sentiment Analysis. In
sentiment analysis, we try to figure out the opinion of
a customer through a piece of text. We first take the
review and check if the review is related to the
specific product with the help of Decision tree. We use
Spam dictionary to identify the spam words in the
reviews. In Text Mining we apply several algorithms
and on the basis of these algorithms we get the
specific results.

<h2>#INTRODUCTION :</h2> In today’s trade market, product reviews play a
vital role for consumers' online shopping activities.
Most of the people go through these reviews before
buying any product online. These reviews for a
product may turn out to be positive or negative.
The positive product review will grab much more
attention of the customer than the negative reviews.
Therefore, these product reviews can affect any
business and they also have the potential to bring
along financial loses or profits. There are many
reviews posted by the customers to put forward
their views regarding the product they have bought.
But along with these true reviews, there are many
fake reviews which can affect the purchase of a
good product.
Generally, reviews appear in the e-commerce web
sites and applications like Amazon, Flipkart and
many more because of financial reasons. Although
lots of product reviews are posted by real
consumers to express their views and share their
shopping experience with other people, more
untruthful reviews appear in the e-business web
sites because of financial reasons. For example, if a
customer writes very negative reviews for a mobile
phone say I-phone 8 on a apple review website due
to its bad service. This review will present an
unfavourable impression of I-phone 8 to its
potential customers and damage its business.
Therefore to avoid business losses caused by this
kind of truthful reviews, the owner of Apple Inc.
Company could plot some people to write
untruthful reviews to improve its reputation.
Because of these fake reviews a customer is
trapped and he makes a purchase of a low quality
product, while decent services or good quality
products could be defamed by untruthful reviews.
The ones who post these malicious reviews to
intentionally mislead consumers or opinion
analysis systems are usually called spammers and
the deceptive reviews are called spam reviews. To
understand how difficult spam detection is, we first
depict a simple example of reviews which was
posted to oyo.com (Indian version). This review
was posted by a person who tries to promote that
hotel and it is hard to identify if it is a fake review
or not: "If you are fine with a small size of the
room (normally found in India) then you will be in
love with this place. Ten minutes walk from the
railway station, cleanliness of room is top priority
for the hotel, and great OYO breakfast with tea/
coffee, outstanding service at a very cheap price.
There is not even a single thing to complain about
it."
“What other people thoughts are and their
thinking” has always remained an important source
of information for the decision making process in
today’s time. Long before the internet came into
being or more so, became as popular as it is today,
people still used to ask each other’s opinions about
goods and products, or consulted surveys to come
to a conclusion.
Times have changed and people have now started
buying products online, thanks to the increasing
popularity of the World Wide Web. With more and
more people becoming comfortable and finding
ease in using the internet, an increasing number of
people post their reviews, ratings and comments
online. This posting of reviews is also resulting to
be highly beneficial for other users who use online
platform to buy products.
Hence, this is resulting in an increased number of
reviews and thus its impact on the purchase of
goods is also increasing. Popular products get
hundreds of reviews which make or break their
sales and thus hold large importance. Our application, thus, proposes to filter these reviews
and separate the spammers from the nonspammers
in order to guarantee more accuracy in
the existing system and enhancing the sales of
genuine products based on real reviews.
