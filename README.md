# Fake-Product-Review-Monitoring

Abstract- Product reviews play an important role in
deciding the sale of a particular product on the ecommerce
websites or applications like Flipkart,
Amazon, Snapdeal, etc. In this paper, we propose a
framework to detect fake product reviews or spam
reviews by using Opinion Mining. The Opinion
mining is also known as Sentiment Analysis. In
sentiment analysis, we try to figure out the opinion of
a customer through a piece of text. We first take the
review and check if the review is related to the
specific product with the help of Decision tree. We use
Spam dictionary to identify the spam words in the
reviews. In Text Mining we apply several algorithms
and on the basis of these algorithms we get the
specific results.
