# Fake-Product-Review-Monitoring

<h2>Abstract:</h2> Product reviews play an important role in
deciding the sale of a particular product on the ecommerce
websites or applications like Flipkart,
Amazon, Snapdeal, etc. In this paper, we propose a
framework to detect fake product reviews or spam
reviews by using Opinion Mining. The Opinion
mining is also known as Sentiment Analysis. In
sentiment analysis, we try to figure out the opinion of
a customer through a piece of text. We first take the
review and check if the review is related to the
specific product with the help of Decision tree. We use
Spam dictionary to identify the spam words in the
reviews. In Text Mining we apply several algorithms
and on the basis of these algorithms we get the
specific results.

<h2>INTRODUCTION :</h2> “What other people thoughts are and their thinking” has always been an important source of information for
most of us during the decision-making process. Long before awareness of the World Wide Web (www) became
widespread, many of us requested our friends to recommend a mixer or to explain who they were thinking to vote for in
elections, requested reference letters regarding job applicants from friends, or consulted Consumer Reports to decide
what mixer to buy. With the rapid expansion of e-commerce, many products are sold on the Web, and many people are
also buying products online. In order to enhance customer satisfaction, requirements and online shopping experience, it
has become a common practice for online merchants to enable their customers to suggest opinions on the products that
they have purchased. With more and more common users becoming comfortable with the Web, a growing number of
people are writing reviews and posting them which are becoming beneficial for others. As a result, the number of reviews
that a product receives grows rapidly. Some popular products can get hundreds of reviews at some large merchant sites.
And our application will give you the promising reviews by filtering them from other sites. And then you can decide
what you want to buy or not.
